Non occurrence patterns identifies the absence of events when detecting a pattern.

Siddhi detects non-occurrence of events using the `not` keyword, and its effective non-occurrence checking period is bounded either by fulfillment of a condition associated by and or via an expiry time using `<time period>`.
