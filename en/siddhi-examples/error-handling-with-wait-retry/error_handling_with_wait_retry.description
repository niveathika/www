This example explains how errors are handled at Sink level by `wait and retry` mode.

In this mode, publishing threads wait in back-off and re-trying mode, and only send the events when the connection is re-established. During this time the threads will not consume any new messages causing the systems to introduce back pressure on the systems that publish to it.
