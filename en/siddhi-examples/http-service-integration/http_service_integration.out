#### Input and Output

Let's assume there is an external HTTP service that performs the loan request validation.

When an event with values [002345, "David Warner", 200000] is sent to `LoanRequestStream` stream then the respective event is sent to the loan validation service.

If the loan request is valid then Siddhi gets a response as shown below from the loan validation service. In this situation, the response code would be `200`.

```
{
	"validation-response": {
		"isValid": true,
		"rate": 12.5,
		"years-approved": 5
	}
}
```

If the loan request is rejected then the loan validation service sent a response with response code `400` with below payload.

```
{
    "validation-response": {
		"isValid": false,
		"reason": "Not a registered user"
	}
}
```

Then Siddhi logs the response message accordingly. If the loan request is accepted then log message would be something similar as below.


`LoanRequestProcessor : LoanResponseStream : Event{timestamp=1575293895348, data=[002345, David Warner, Loan Request is accepted for processing], isExpired=false`
