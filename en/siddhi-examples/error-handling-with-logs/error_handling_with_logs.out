Above is a simple example to publish abnormal Glucose reading events to an unavailable HTTP endpoint and error is handled by logging the events to the logs.

#### Input

Below event is sent to `GlucoseReadingStream` stream,

[`'Get-1024'`, `'Level2'`, `'1576829362'`, `10348`, `'Alex'`, `'John'`, `250`]


#### Output

After processing, the following log gets printed in the console:

`ERROR {io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.Sink} - Error on 'ErrorHandling'. Dropping event at Sink 'http' at 'AbnormalGlucoseReadingStream' as its still trying to reconnect!, events dropped '{"event":{"timeStampInLong":1576829362,"locationRoom":"1024","locationBed":"Level2","sensorID":10348,"patientFullName":"Alex John","sensorReadingValue":250.0}}'`
