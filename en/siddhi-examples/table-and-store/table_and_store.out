#### Event at table and store

When `SensorIdInfoTable` table contains a recode [`'aq-14'`, `'789'`], and when an event with values [`'aq-14'`, `35.4`] is sent to `TemperatureStream` stream.

The event will get converted and added to the `TemperatureLogTable` table as below.

[`'aq-14'`, `'789'`, `35.4`]

#### Retrieving values from tables and stores

The stored values can be retrieved by join tables and stores with the streams as in the `Join-query` depicted in the example, or using on-demand queries.

The data in `TemperatureDetailsTable` can be retrieved via on-demand queries as below, using the [On Demand Query REST API](../../rest-guides/on-demand-query-api/) or by calling `query()` method of `SiddhiAppRuntime`.

```siddhi
from TemperatureDetailsTable
select *
```
