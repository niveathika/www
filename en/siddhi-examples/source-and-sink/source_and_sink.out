#### Input

When a JSON message in the following default message format is sent to url `http://0.0.0.0:8006/temp` with content type `application/json`.
It will automatically get mapped to an event in the `TemperatureStream` stream.

```json
{
   "event":{
      "sensorId":"aq-14",
      "temperature":35.4
   }
}
```

To process custom input messages, please refer the examples related to Input Data Mapping.

#### Output

After processing, the event arriving at `TemperatureOnlyStream` will be emitted via `log` and `kafka` sinks.

As `log` sink uses `passThrough` mapper by default, it directly logs the Siddhi Events to the console as following;

```bash
Event{timestamp=1574515771712, data=[35.4], isExpired=false}
```

The `kafka` sink maps the event to a custom JSON message as below and publishes it to the `temperature` topic.

```json
{"temp":"35.4"}
```

To output messages using other message formats, pleases refer the examples related to Output Data Mapping.
