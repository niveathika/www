Provides introduction to basic Siddhi attribute types which are `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `string`, and `object`, and some key functions such as `convert()`, `instanceOf...()`, and `cast()`.

In Siddhi, other types such as list, map, etc, should be passed as `object` into streams. For more information on other types refer other examples under Values and Types section.

For information [values](../../query-guide/#value), and other useful [functions](../../query-guide#function), refer the Siddhi [query guide](../../query-guide).
